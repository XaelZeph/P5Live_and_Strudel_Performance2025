# P5Live_and_Strudel_Performance2025
Code for a P5Live and Strudel live coding performance, performed by Xael and Gray in Fall of 2025

## How to perform it yourself
### P5Live
Copy and paste the P5Live.js into https://teddavis.org/p5live/ and it should run automatically. As this is a **live coding** performance, there are lines of commented code, that would have otherwise been commented/uncommented as the performance goes on.

### Strudel
Copy and paste the strudel.js into https://strudel.cc/ and press run. Like the P5Live code, this was also **live coded** which means that certain elements were uncommented/commented as the performance goes on to add layering.

Play around yourself and see what you can perform!
